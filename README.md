The most difficult part of this assigment for me was understanding and executing how to get different javascript files to work together. It was a challenge to grasp the concept initially but with help I was able to figure it out and will be able to tackle a similar problem in the future with ease. Most of the HTML I shamelessly modeled off the example page, since the goal of the assigment was to learn how to use express and heroku.
